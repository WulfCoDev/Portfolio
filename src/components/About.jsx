          I’m an IT and software enthusiast with a background in Computer
          Science and Physics. I hold the CompTIA triad (A+, Network+,
          Security+) and enjoy building projects that combine problem-solving
          with creativity. Outside of tech, I’m passionate about gaming, movies,
          and motorsports. Currently, I’m working towards Associates of Science
          degrees in Computer Science and Physics with a transfer goal to UC
          Riverside in 2027 to obtain my Bachelors then Masters degree.
          Furthermore, I am seeking entry-level IT or software engineering
          roles.
